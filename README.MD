# PSXPackager

PSXPackager is a port of the `popstation-md` C source to C#.

There is no GUI right now, it's just a command line tool to help batch process files. I may add a GUI later.

Feel free to take the Popstation library and use it as you like.

# Features

* Supports direct conversion of .7z files using SevenZipExtractor  
* Supports merging multi-track .BIN + .CUE
* Supports writing track information to PBP for audio 
* Convert .BIN or .IMG to .PBP
* Extract .BIN file from .PBP
* PBP Compression levels from 0 to 9
* Uses SharpZipLib for compression
* Uses a modified DiscUtil for ISO reading to auto-detect the Disc ID

# Usage

## Convert a .7z, .BIN, .IMG or .ISO to a .PBP

```
psxpackager -i <path_to_file> -o <output_path> [-l <compression_level>] 
```

Since the 7zip library is being used, .7z, .rar, and .zip files are supported as inputs. The file only needs to contain a .iso, .img or .bin file.

If the compressed file has multiple .bin files, PSXPackager will look for a .cue file and merge them into a single .bin file.

Set the compression level to a value from 0 to 9, with 0 being no compression and 9 being the highest compression level. If not specified, it will default to 5.

## Convert multi-track .CUE file to .PBP

If the file is a CUE file with multiple .BIN files, the files are merged into one .BIN, and the tracks are updated to point to locations in the single .BIN.  The track 
information is used to build a TOC (table of contents) for the PBP ISO.

## Convert a .PBP to a .BIN

PSXPackager checks the file extension to decide whether to extract or convert

```
psxpackager -i <path_to_file> -o <output_path>
```

## Convert all .7z files in a folder to .PBP

```
psxpackager -b <path_containing_files> -e .7z -o <output_path>
```

# TODO

* Multi-disc PBP support
* Get DiscID from ISO in PBP
